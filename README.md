This repository contains my practical implementations of selected examples from *On Java 8* by Bruce Eckel.  
I am not implementing every example from the book(s) — only those I find interesting or useful.  
In the future, I plan to expand with examples from other classic Java books, but *On Java 8* is the starting point.

## 📂 Project Structure

Examples are organized by **topics** rather than chapters, so the repository can grow naturally:

- `basics/` – fundamental syntax, variables, operators
- `oop/` – classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- `generics/` – type safety, wildcards, API design
- `concurrency/` – threads, executors, synchronization
- `streams/` – functional programming, lambdas, streams API
- `collections/` – lists, sets, maps, iterators
- `io/` – file handling, serialization
- `advanced/` – reflection, annotations, JVM internals

Each folder may contain subfolders for finer granularity (e.g., `basics/string/example1`) and includes examples with commentary and improvements.

## 🛠 Requirements

- JDK 25 (or whichever version you’re using)
- Gradle 9.2 (wrapper included in repo)
- Tested on Windows 11
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

---

## ⚙️ Build Tool

This project uses **Gradle** for build and dependency management.

### Build & Run

To compile and run an example:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew run --args="basics.HelloWorld"
```
Replace `basics.HelloWorld` with the fully qualified class name of the example you want to run.

---

## 📖 Notes
Each example may include:
- Selected code inspired by *On Java 8* (not a full reproduction of the book’s examples)
- My commentary and improvements
- Edge cases or compiler error demos
- Additional resources (if required, placed under `src/main/resources`)

### ⚠️ About Compile‑Error Examples 
This repository contains both working examples and examples that intentionally produce compiler errors. 
These error‑producing snippets are included to illustrate Java’s rules and limitations. 
- All error examples are **commented out** so the project can compile cleanly.

**Why?** 
- Commented examples let you read the code and understand the issue without breaking the build. 


---

## 📚 Documentation
- Commentary is embedded directly in the source code for clarity.
- Topic folders act as a **reference library** of reusable examples.
- Future plan: expand documentation into a `docs/` folder with summaries, diagrams, and links to examples.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [x] Initial Gradle setup with HelloWorld
- [ ] Add examples from *On Java 8*
- [ ] Expand with examples from other Java books
- [ ] Add topic‑specific resources (e.g., JSON, text files under `src/main/resources`)
- [ ] Continuous integration with GitHub Actions (`./gradlew build` on push)
