This repository contains my practical implementations of examples from *On Java 8* by Bruce Eckel.  
In the future, I plan to expand with examples from other classic Java books, but *On Java 8* is the starting point.

## 📂 Project Structure

Examples are organized by **topics** rather than chapters, so the repository can grow naturally:

- `basics/` – fundamental syntax, variables, operators
- `oop/` – classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- `generics/` – type safety, wildcards, API design
- `concurrency/` – threads, executors, synchronization
- `streams/` – functional programming, lambdas, streams API
- `collections/` – lists, sets, maps, iterators
- `io/` – file handling, serialization
- `advanced/` – reflection, annotations, JVM internals

Each folder may contain subfolders for finer granularity (e.g., `basics/string/example1`) and includes examples with commentary and improvements.

## ⚙️ Build Tool

This project uses **Gradle** for build and dependency management.

### Build & Run

To compile and run an example:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew run --args="basics.HelloWorld"
```
Replace `basics.HelloWorld` with the fully qualified class name of the example you want to run.

---

## 📖 Notes
Each example may include:
- Original code inspired by *On Java 8*
- My commentary and improvements
- Edge cases or compiler error demos
- Additional resources (if required, placed under `src/main/resources`)

---

## 📚 Documentation
- Commentary is embedded directly in the source code for clarity.
- Topic folders act as a **reference library** of reusable examples.
- Future plan: expand documentation into a `docs/` folder with summaries, diagrams, and links to examples.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [x] Initial Gradle setup with HelloWorld
- [ ] Add examples from *On Java 8*
- [ ] Expand with examples from other Java books
- [ ] Add topic‑specific resources (e.g., JSON, text files under `src/main/resources`)
- [ ] Continuous integration with GitHub Actions (`./gradlew build` on push)
